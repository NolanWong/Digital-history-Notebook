Mathematical biologist Alan Turing is best known for his work during WW2, helping the allies decipher Nazi codes. During and for this  work, he created the Turing machine, which was an algorithmic machine that manipulated symbols on a strip of tape. Later, he worked on the Automatic Computing Engine. This machine was the first ever Stored-program computer. These are computers that store instructions in electronic form. This computer was later developed into the MOSAIC, then the G-15. This G-15 is considered to be the first personal computer.
