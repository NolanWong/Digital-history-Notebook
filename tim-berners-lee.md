Practically everything that we use today is directly related to the work that this absolute mad genius developed. While working for CERN in 1980, he introduced the concept of hypertext, the way we transfer data for websites. In 1989, he introduced the idea of linking hypertext with TCP and created the foundation of the WWW. For this, he developed the first web browser. Then, in 1994, he founded the W3C, the council overseeing the continued development of the WWW. Skipping ahead around four accomplishments, he has apologised for the two slashes. In 2004, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
