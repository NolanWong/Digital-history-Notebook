Fun fact: over 50% of Americans use apple products. The man behind these products: Steve Jobs. Jobs began his computing career in 1974 working for Atari. Steve Wozniak stated that they only hired him becauseof the PONG electronics board he gave to Jobs. Nolan bushnel, Atari's founder, described him as "often the smartest person in the room, and the kind that would let you know it." In 1976, Jobs sugested that he and Wozniak sell Wozniak's Apple 1 computer. The two settled on "Apple" after a visit to All One Farm commune in Oregon. Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $280 in 2024) each.
